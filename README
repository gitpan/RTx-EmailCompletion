NAME
    RTx::EmailCompletion - Add auto completion to RT email field

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of RTx::EmailCompletion.

DESCRIPTION
    I'm so tired to type email address by hand that I've done this module to
    add AJAX autocompletion on all email field of RT

    There's 3 things :

    *   a small web service "html/Ajax/EmailCompletion" which search in all
        known users in the database ;

    *   prototype library to manipulate DOM and scriptaculous library to
        autocomplete ;

    *   a small javascript which parse html pages and add autocomplete on
        known input tags.

INSTALLATION
    Install it like a standard perl module :

     RTHOME=/opt/rt3 perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

HOW TO ADD FIELD TO AUTOCOMPLETION
    If you find email field without autocomplete, you can modify
    "html/NoAuth/js/emailcompletion.js" to handle this field (and email me
    to patch this module).

    At the beginning of this file you will find two global vars
    "multipleCompletion" and "singleCompletion". They are array of regexp.

    Regexp must match all the word because "^" and "$" are added for
    matching. So if you want to match "Field1" and "Field2" you must add
    something like "Field." or better "Field[12]".

HISTORY
    The first version (unreleased) modify html pages. The better method
    actually used allow this module to be compatible with, virtually, all RT
    release.
